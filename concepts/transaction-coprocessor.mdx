title: Transaction CoProcessor
---

The **Transaction Coprocessor** is Aarc's dedicated **off-chain engine** that supervises the entire lifecycle of a one-click deposit, from initial user intent to final asset delivery, or, if needed, an automatic refund. By monitoring cross-chain conditions and adjusting routes in real time, it ensures each deposit matches the user's specified intent.

## Core Functions

---

### Transaction Monitoring

The Coprocessor tracks each step of a deposit's flow, detecting completed bridging or swaps and identifying when subsequent steps are needed:

- **Live Data Feeds -** It collects real-time information about liquidity, gas prices, and network congestion across supported chains.
- **Dynamic Adjustments -** When the initial route faces slowdowns, congestion, or low liquidity, the Coprocessor recalculates and submits new bridging or swap transactions to maintain smooth execution.

By coordinating cross-chain actions (bridging, contract interactions, and final settlement), the Coprocessor **orchestrates** all off-chain logic needed to fulfill deposits automatically.

### Retries & Recovery Coordination

If a deposit encounters a failed step (from liquidity issues, network problems, or other errors), the Coprocessor launches **automated retries**:

- **Fresh Execution Quotes -** It finds new aggregator routes, bridging paths, or swap options to complete the transaction.
- **Scheduled Intervals -** Retries occur at 5-minute intervals for up to 30 minutes to complete the deposit as intended.
- **Failover to Refund -** If retries can't deliver the correct assets, the Coprocessor automatically refunds the user's wallet, preventing stuck or partial transactions.

This recovery system ensures each transaction either completes as requested or returns funds automatically.
