title: Token Issuers (Assets, Memes, Governance)
---

Aarc provides **modular deposit infrastructure** for issuers of stablecoins, wrapped assets (like **WBTC** or **WETH**), memecoins, and governance tokens. Through **generating a unique deposit address** for each purchase or mint, we enable **one-click** **execution** from **any chain**, **CEX**, or **fiat** source. This streamlined approach eliminates manual bridging, token approvals, and destination-chain gas requirements—resulting in higher user participation and more efficient token distribution.

## Examples

* **Stablecoin Mints or Purchases**
 Whether you're issuing a fiat-backed or algorithmic stablecoin, users can acquire it in a single step from any asset or chain—Aarc handles all swaps, bridging, and final contract calls behind the scenes.

* **Wrapped Asset Onboarding (ETH/BTC)**
 Issuing a wrapped version of a major asset? Aarc helps users convert their existing ETH, BTC, or other tokens into your wrapped asset in one transaction—no separate bridging or deposit approvals needed.

* **Memecoin Launch**
 Meme tokens thrive on fast, frictionless user adoption. Aarc's one-click execution lets new holders buy or mint your memecoin instantly, boosting viral growth and conversion rates.

* **Governance Token Sales**
 Distribute protocol tokens for DAOs or DeFi platforms through a single purchase link with Lintree checkouts, allowing participants to pay with any token from any chain. Aarc handles the bridging, ensuring the correct amount reaches your governance token's smart contract.

## Benefits

* **Higher Conversion Rates** — A simplified buying and minting process reduces abandoned transactions, increasing token sales and distribution success.

* **Low-Code Integration** — Deploy our widget or Execution API to connect with your mint or sale contract. Aarc manages the entire cross-chain flow, enabling launch in about 30 minutes.

* **Unique Deposit Addresses** — Each transaction uses its own **single-use** address, eliminating allowance requirements and reducing user confusion.

* **Automatic Refunds** — If routing fails, buyers receive automatic refunds—preventing lost funds and minimizing support needs.

* **No Destination Gas Required** — Users don't need native gas on your chain, removing a major barrier for first-time token buyers.

* **Universal Accessibility** — Accept funds from multiple networks, fiat onramps, and centralized exchanges to maximize your project's reach.

* **Security & Reliability** — Single-use deposit addresses enhance security. Automatic refunds ensure transactions either complete successfully or return users' funds safely.
