Aarc provides **modular deposit infrastructure** for trading bots that facilitate crypto trading, gaming, NFT drops, or community rewards. By **generating a unique deposit address** for each transaction, Aarc enables **one-click deposits** from any chain, CEX, or fiat source. This removes bridging hassles, token approvals, and destination-chain gas fees, ultimately driving higher user activation and transaction volume for your trading bot.

## Examples

### 1. **Bot Wallet Funding**
Users can fund a bot-controlled wallet in one click from any chain or exchange. They simply send tokens to the deposit address, and the bot receives the correct asset on its chosen chain.

### 2. **Raids & NFT Mints**
Whether it's meme token raids or community reward NFT mints, Aarc converts user deposits into one-click execution, no bridging or manual swaps.

### 3. **Tipping & Community Engagement**
Community members can tip or reward each other in a Telegram channel without worrying about chain mismatches, approvals, or stuck funds.

## Benefits

* **One-Click User Onboarding -** A single-step deposit flow allows users to get started quickly, boosting conversion and engagement.

* **Low-Code Integration -** Embed our link directly within your bot flow. Specify where funds should land (the bot's wallet), and we handle execution. Go live in ~30 minutes.

* **Unique Deposit Addresses -** Each deposit has its own address. Users don't need to grant token allowances or perform manual approvals, reducing confusion and risk.

* **Automatic Refunds -** If deposits fail (e.g., network issues), funds revert to the user automatically, no manual refunds or support tickets for stuck tokens.

* **No Destination Gas Required -** Users don't need native gas on the chain the bot is using. Aarc handles gas coverage behind the scenes.

* **Improved User Experience -** One-click deposits remove friction from bridging and token conversions, making your bot accessible to a wider audience.

* **Security & Reliability -** Single-use addresses reduce potential attack vectors. Auto-refunds guarantee that deposits are either fulfilled or returned, enhancing trust in your bot.
