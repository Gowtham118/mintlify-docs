# Developer Dashboard & API Keys ðŸŒˆ

The **Aarc Developer Dashboard** is your central platform for creating dApp projects, managing API keys, configuring no-code widgets, and monitoring usage analytics.

- **Developer Dashboard Button â†’ dashboard.aarc.xyz**

## Getting Started

1. **Log In or Sign Up**
   Visit the Aarc Developer Dashboard to create an account or log in.

2. **Create a dApp Project**
   Click **Create New Project** and give it a descriptive name (e.g., "My DeFi App"). Each project has its own configuration, API keys, widget settings, and analytics dataâ€”enabling easy management of multiple environments or applications.

## Dashboard Functions

### Generating & Managing API Keys

To manage API keys, navigate to the **API Keys** tab in your project dashboard. Here you can view, generate, and rotate keys as needed. For security, rotate keys regularly, revoke compromised ones immediately, and never expose them in public repositories or client-side code. Create separate projects for different applications to maintain clear security boundaries and usage tracking.

### No-Code Widgets & Hosted Linktree

Our platform offers two powerful features: embeddable widgets for seamless cross-chain executions and a hosted Linktree page. The Linktree page serves as a customizable landing page where users can easily access buy, bridge, or swap optionsâ€”all with minimal development effort.

### Analytics

The analytics dashboard delivers comprehensive usage metrics for tracking transactions, users, and revenue. It provides simple data export options and integrates seamlessly with your existing tools for performance monitoring and reporting.
