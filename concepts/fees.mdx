title: Fees
---

Aarc is committed to **complete fee transparency**. We currently **do not charge any additional protocol or service fees** ,  users only incur the standard blockchain and liquidity provider (LP) costs outlined below.

## Fee Components

1. **Gas Fees**
    - **Context**: Payment to blockchain validators for processing each transaction step.
    - **Typical Range**: Fluctuates based on network congestion, transaction complexity, and current gas prices.
    - **Implementation**: Aarc bundles bridging, swaps, and final calls into a batched transactions, reducing the total number of approvals and manual steps.
2. **Liquidity Provider (LP) Fees**
    - **Context**: Cost to DEXes, aggregators, or bridge providers facilitating asset swaps and transfers.
    - **Typical Range**: Often **0.05%–0.3%** depending on the asset pair and selected route.
    - **Implementation**: Deducted from the swapped or bridged amount. We always aim to minimize these costs.
3. **Max Slippage**
    - **Context**: This provides a buffer against price changes between quote generation and transaction confirmation.
    - **Typical Range**: A typical slippage might be **0.2%**, balancing execution finality with capital efficiency.
    - **Implementation**:
        
        ```
        Max Slippage (%) = [(Quoted Amount_Out - Minimum Amount_Out) / Quoted Amount_Out] × 100 + 0.02%
        ```
        
4. **Price Impact**
    - **Context**: The effect of trade size on market price, particularly for large trades or lower-liquidity pairs.
    - **Implementation**:
        
        ```
        Price Impact (%) = [(Quoted Amount_In_USD - Quoted Amount_Out_USD) / Quoted Amount_In_USD] × 100
        ```
        
    - **Note**: Aarc's aggregator logic seeks routes with minimal price impact, though market-driven changes cannot be completely eliminated.
