## Making Web3 Work 🔑

Web3 adoption faces two major hurdles: complicated wallet setups and funding those wallets. Dynamic solves the first challenge by providing seamless Web2-style authentication (Google, Twitter, Discord, etc.) with built-in wallet creation. Aarc tackles the second problem by making it incredibly easy to fund those wallets from various sources(Wallet / CEX / On-ramp).

Together, they create a complete onboarding solution that feels familiar to mainstream users while unlocking the full power of Web3.

## Integration 🛠️

This quickstart guide will show you how to:
- Connect Dynamic's authentication system with Aarc's FundKit
- Create a seamless user journey from login to funded wallet
- Implement this in a React application with just a few components

## Real-World Use Cases 💡

- **Gaming platforms**: Let players sign in with their favorite social accounts and easily purchase in-game assets
- **NFT marketplaces**: Enable quick authentication and funding for first-time collectors
- **DAOs**: Simplify the onboarding process for new community members
- **Content platforms**: Allow creators to monetize through tokens with minimal technical barriers
