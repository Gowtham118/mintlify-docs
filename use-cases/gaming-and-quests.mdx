title: Gaming and Quests
---

Aarc's **modular deposit infrastructure** streamlines user onboarding for blockchain-based games, questing apps, and action-to-earn experiences. By **generating a unique deposit address** for each transaction, we enable **one-click deposits** from **any chain, CEX, or fiat source**—without token approvals, bridging steps, or gas costs on the destination chain. This frictionless approach increases user participation, drives in-game purchases, and encourages on-chain quest engagement.

## Examples

- **In-Game Token Purchases**
    
    Users can buy in-game tokens (e.g., skins, points, or an ERC-20 utility token) in one step, even if their funds are on a different chain or in a centralized exchange. Aarc handles all conversions and delivers the correct asset to the game's contract or the user's in-game wallet.
    
- **NFT Minting for Quests or Collectibles**
    
    Whether you're offering NFT badges for completed quests or selling limited-edition character skins, Aarc lets users purchase or mint items with a single click. We handle all token swaps and bridging, eliminating the need for users to understand chain mechanics.
    
- **Fiat Onramp Integration**
    
    For crypto newcomers, Aarc partners with **fiat providers** to enable gaming wallet funding via credit card, bank transfer, or Apple Pay—allowing users to jump straight into the action without dealing with token approvals or bridging.
    

## Benefits

- **Higher User Conversion -** Simplify the journey from interest to active play. One-click purchasing for tokens and NFTs reduces drop-off rates.
- **Low-Code Integration -** Embed our widget or API. Configure the **destination contract** (e.g., your game's reward contract or NFT mint), and Aarc manages cross-chain routing. Launch in about 30 minutes.
- **Unique Deposit Addresses -** Each purchase, mint, or deposit uses its own **single-use** address, eliminating token approvals and minimizing user error.
- **Automatic Refunds -** If bridging or routing fails within 30 minutes, Aarc automatically refunds the user—preventing lost funds and reducing support needs.
- **No Destination Gas Required -** Users don't need native tokens on your chain. Aarc covers gas costs behind the scenes, removing a key barrier for new users.
- **Universal Accessibility -** Accept funds from multiple chains, fiat onramps, or CEX accounts to maximize your platform's reach.
- **Security & Reliability -** Single-use addresses protect users from approval exploits. Automatic refunds ensure transactions either complete successfully or reverse safely.
