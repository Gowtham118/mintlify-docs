## Introduction

### What is Aarc?

Aarc's Intent Execution Protocol is a destination-first solution that enables atomic cross-chain transactions through a single API. It simplifies complex cross-chain operations by abstracting away the complexities of bridging, swapping, and executing transactions across different networks.

### Why Use Aarc?

## Authentication

### API Keys

Generate your API key through the [Aarc Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.aarc.xyz)

## Quickstart

### Simple Example

Here's a basic example of depositing 10 USDC from Ethereum to a DeFi protocol on Polygon:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate Deposit Address">
    ```bash
    curl -X GET https://bridge-swap.aarc.xyz/v3/deposit-address \
      -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "destinationChainId": "137",
        "destinationTokenAddress": "0x2791bca1f2de4661ed88a30c99a7a9449aa84174",
        "toAmount": "10",
        "destinationRecipient": "0xDeFiContract",
        "transferType": "wallet",
        "routeType": "value"
      }'
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Schedule Transaction">
    ```bash
    curl -X POST https://bridge-swap.aarc.xyz/v3/schedule-transaction \
      -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "fromAddress": "0x...",
        "toAddress": "0x...",
        "token": "USDC",
        "amount": "10",
        "scheduleTime": "2024-03-20T10:00:00Z"
      }'
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check Status">
    ```bash
    curl -X GET https://bridge-swap.aarc.xyz/v3/request-status/{requestId} \
      -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Verify Compatibility

Before initiating transactions, check supported tokens and chains:
- [`supported-chains`](./endpoints/supported-chains) - List of supported networks
- [`supported-tokens`](./endpoints/supported-tokens) - List of supported tokens
