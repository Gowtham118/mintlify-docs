description: Guide for using Execution Cloud
---

Aarc provides Execution Cloud Web Widget and Execution Cloud SDK to enhance smart transactions and web3 UX.

\
&#x20;To break it down further, one can integrate Execution Cloud into their dApp, empowering users to

* `Buy` anything on any chain; say, [ Basenji on Base with assets from Binance](https://link.aarc.xyz/basenjibase)
* `Checkout` (custom cross-chain contract call); like minting an NFT with a credit card

through various payment methods (CEX/ Fiat / Bridge & Swap ).&#x20;

So one can fully focus on their core mission, leaving the complexity of abstraction to Aarc.

### Pre-requisite

To integrate Aarc, youâ€™ll need an API key which can be generated from your [dashboard](https://dashboard.aarc.xyz/signup). Each account can create up to three keys, enabling seamless integration across projects.

### Web Widget

Web Widget will provide a plug-and-play iFrame widget which you can use with any application built with any JS frameworks like React, Next.js.&#x20;

### SDK

You can also watch a video tutorial to code along and get started with the SDK. Check out the sample apps built using [Next.js](https://github.com/aarc-xyz/FDK-Widget-Next-JS.git) and [React ](https://github.com/aarc-xyz/aarc-react-widget-demo)to explore different implementations.
