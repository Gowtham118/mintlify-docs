title: Deposit Addresses
---

Aarc's **Deposit Addresses** are **single-use** smart contracts that securely receive funds for each cross-chain transaction. They power our **one-click deposit** flow, ensuring transactions are isolated, safe, and trackable, without requiring token allowances or manual bridging.

## Core Functions

---

### **Single-Use & Ephemeral**

Each transaction, defined by its source chain, asset, and destination, generates a **unique deposit address**. After completion or refund, the address is disabled and cannot be reused. This prevents fund mixing, reduces security risks, and maximizes user safety.

### **On-Demand Deployment**

Deposit addresses are created through a **factory contract** when a new deposit intent is initiated. This **lightweight** approach eliminates the need for users to maintain allowances or manage multiple addresses, while enabling isolated deposit tracking.

### **One-to-One Transaction Mapping**

Every intent has its own unique address. This **one-to-one mapping** ensures precise fund routing and prevents interference between transactions. The flow is clear and predictable, funds arriving at a deposit address belong **only** to that specific transaction.

### **Single Asset Handling**

Each deposit address processes **one asset type** per deposit. This focused approach simplifies tracking and eliminates the complexity of multi-token transactions. By handling single assets, we minimize errors and optimize the deposit process.

### **Security**

Deposit addresses are programmed to only send funds to the liquidity router to prevent unauthorized transfer of funds or potential security breaches.
