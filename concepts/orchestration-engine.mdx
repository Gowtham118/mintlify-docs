The **Liquidity Router Contract** is a core component of Aarc's **execution infrastructure**. It manages bridging, swaps, and final contract interactions on the destination chain, delivering exactly the tokens and amounts users specify or providing an **automatic refund** if transaction fails.

## Core Functions

---

### Execution & Security

- **Controlled Access -** Only **whitelisted Aarc relayers** can call the router, preventing unauthorized access to user deposits.
- **Intent Validation -** Each transaction uses an **EIP-712** signature to verify it matches the user's deposit intent precisely. There are no hidden steps or redirections.
- **Single-Use Logic -** Using **unique deposit addresses**, funds are never pooled. Every transaction operates independently, isolating risk and eliminating the need for token allowances.

These safeguards ensure tokens arrive on the correct chain in exactly the amounts requested.

### Transaction Guarantees

- **Exact Delivery -** The router guarantees that final output on the destination chain matches the user's specified asset and amount, essential for DeFi actions (e.g., vault deposits) or NFT purchases.
- **Atomic Execution -** Transactions either **fully complete** or **revert**. When slippage limits or liquidity constraints aren't met, the router stops the process and initiates a refund, preventing partial executions and stuck tokens.

### Supported Assets & Sources

- **ERC-20 Tokens & Native Assets -** Includes common EVM tokens (USDT, USDC, DAI) and chain-native coins like ETH or MATIC.
- **Multi-Channel Funding -** Deposits can come from on-chain wallets (e.g., MetaMask), centralized exchanges (e.g., Coinbase, Binance), or fiat onramps, without additional steps.

Users don't need separate approvals or chain-native gas on the destination; Aarc handles these details for a true **one-click** experience.

### Fee Handling

- **No Extra Protocol Fee -** Aarc charges no additional protocol fees beyond standard **network** and **liquidity provider** costs.
- **Transparent Costs -** All **bridging** and **swap fees** are displayed upfront before confirmation. Network gas fees vary with chain congestion; LP and Slippage fees typically range from **0.05%â€“0.3%**.
- **Minimal Overhead -** By combining bridging, swaps, and final calls into one transaction, the Router's total fees are often lower than executing steps separately.

### Failures & Refunds

If a transaction cannot complete within **30 minutes** (due to insufficient liquidity, network delays, or route failures), the Router automatically initiates a refund:

- **Refund Chain & Asset**Users receive refunds on the chain where the transaction failed, typically in stable tokens (e.g., USDC/USDT) or ETH. For failures before bridging, users receive their original asset.
- **Partial Gas Costs**While pre-failure gas fees aren't recoverable, Aarc's aggregator logic minimizes these costs.
- **Guaranteed Outcome**Users always receive either their exact requested amount on the destination chain or a refund, eliminating uncertainty and stuck funds.
