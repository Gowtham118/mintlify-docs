Aarc serves as **modular deposit infrastructure** for any DeFi application, from perpetual DEXs and liquidity pre-deposits to yield farming, prediction markets, and staking protocols. By **generating a unique deposit address** for each transaction, Aarc enables **one-click deposits** from any chain, centralized exchange (CEX), or fiat source. This streamlined approach simplifies user onboarding by eliminating manual bridging, token approvals, and destination-chain gas fees, ultimately boosting your Total Value Locked (TVL), trading volumes, and user retention.

## Examples

### 1. **Margin Deposits**
Users can fund margin accounts on your perp platform with a single click from any chain, in any asset, without bridging or swaps.

### 2. **LP Mining & Yield Deposits**
Liquidity incentive programs thrive on steady deposits. Our streamlined flow enables users to add liquidity from any chain or CEX in one step, eliminating approval steps and resource locks.

### 3. **Prediction & Gambling Markets**
Users simply send funds from their source chain, and they arrive ready for contract execution, no bridging or token approvals needed.

## Benefits

* **Higher TVL & Trading Volumes -** Our single-step deposit flow reduces onboarding friction, leading to more successful deposits and greater overall liquidity and trading activity.

* **Low-Code Integration -** Embed our UI widget or connect via our Execution API. Specify your **destination contract** (e.g., a vault or pool), and we'll handle cross-chain routing. Launch in about 30 minutes, letting your team focus on core product features.

* **Unique Deposit Addresses -** Each deposit receives its own single-use address, eliminating the need for token allowances. Users simply send funds, reducing both risk and complexity.

* **Automatic Refunds -** We retry transactions for 30 minutes before marking them as failed. If completion fails (due to liquidity or network issues), we automatically refunds the user, no stuck funds or manual intervention needed.

* **No Destination Gas Required -** We cover gas fees on the destination chain, removing the need for users to hold native tokens. This eliminates a major barrier in cross-chain deposits.

* **Improved User Experience -** One-click deposits replace complex bridging and swaps, increasing user satisfaction, boosting conversion rates, and reducing support needs.

* **Security & Reliability -** Single-use deposit addresses eliminate token approval requirements, enhancing security. Automatic refunds safeguard users from failed transactions and stuck funds.
