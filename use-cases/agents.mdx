Aarc serves as **modular deposit infrastructure** for on-chain agents—spanning autonomous protocols or bot-driven systems. By **generating a unique deposit address** for each transaction, Aarc enables **one-click deposits** from any chain, centralized exchange (CEX), or fiat source. This streamlined approach simplifies capital inflows into agent-managed smart contracts, eliminating manual bridging, token approvals, and destination-chain gas fees. The result: more seamless cross-chain collaboration, greater fund mobility, and reduced overhead for both users and agent developers.

## Examples

### 1. **User-to-Agent Deposits**
Users can send capital to an agent-managed vault in one click - no bridging or token swaps required, even if they're on a different chain.

### 2. **Agent-to-Agent Transfers**
Agents operating on different networks can pay or send funds among themselves via unique deposit addresses, cutting out complex execution steps.

## Benefits

* **Frictionless Capital Inflows -** A single deposit address handles all bridging and swaps, letting agents collect funds from any user on any chain with minimal effort.

* **Low-Code Integration -** Embed our UI widget or connect via our Execution API. Just set your agent's **destination contract**, and we handle cross-chain routing—launch in ~30 minutes.

* **Unique Deposit Addresses -** Each transaction has its own single-use address, eliminating token approvals. Users simply send funds, reducing complexity and risk.

* **Automatic Refunds -** Transactions retry for 30 minutes if they encounter issues. If execution fails, the user is automatically refunded—no manual back-and-forth.

* **No Destination Gas Required -** Aarc covers any gas on the target chain, so neither your agent nor the user needs to acquire native tokens.

* **Enhanced Operational Ease -** By removing manual bridging steps, agents can scale to multiple networks without building custom bridging logic or aggregator flows.

* **Security & Reliability -** Single-use deposit addresses minimize attack surfaces. Automatic refunds protect users from partial or stuck transfers, keeping agent-based processes robust.
