Linktree checkouts are a powerful solution that allows cryptocurrency projects to offer seamless token purchasing experiences to their users through customized, branded pages hosted on our infrastructure. This service eliminates the need for projects to build their own purchase flows while providing their users with a trusted, reliable way to acquire tokens.

## How It Works

When integrated, each project receives a dedicated, branded page at a unique URL (e.g., `link.aarc.xyz/[project-name]`). Users can visit this page to directly purchase the project's token through our trusted payment processing system.

## Quickstart

1. **Creating an Account and API Key**
   * Sign up on the [dashboard ](https://dashboard.aarc.xyz/signup)to create an account. Each account supports up to three API keys.
2. **Creating a Hosted Page**
   * To create a Hosted Page, you can:
     * Use the dashboard for a user-friendly interface. _Coming soon!_
     * Send a `POST` request to the [`v3/store-verified-link`](../execution-api/link-tree-for-checkouts/store-verified-link) endpoint with the required token data and your API key. This endpoint generates a Hosted Page that can be used for seamless integration.
