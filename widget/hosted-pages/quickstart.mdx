1. **Creating an Account and API Key**
   * Sign up on the [dashboard ](https://dashboard.aarc.xyz/signup)to create an account. Each account supports up to three API keys.
2. **Creating a Hosted Page**
   * To create a Hosted Page, you can:
     * Use the dashboard for a user-friendly interface. _Coming soon!_
     * Send a `POST` request to the [`v3/store-verified-link`](../execution-api/endpoints/store-verified-link) endpoint with the required token data and your API key. This endpoint generates a Hosted Page that can be used for seamless integration.
