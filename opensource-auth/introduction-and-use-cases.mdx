# Introduction & Use Cases

## Introduction

***

OpenAuth is a groundbreaking open-source project that seamlessly integrates social logins with wallets on decentralized applications (DApps). Built on Lit Protocol's robust infrastructure, OpenAuth delivers a secure, user-friendly experience that prevents fund and access fragmentation while fully embracing decentralization principles.

In a decentralized world, accessibility shouldn't compromise security or ownership. OpenAuth embodies this philosophy, offering a solution that combines the convenience of social logins with the security and control of decentralized wallets.

| Features                                                                          | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <h4><strong>Customisable Native Modal and In-dapp Wallet Manager</strong></h4>    | We provide a customizable widget modal and an in-dApp Wallet Manager, allowing developers to tailor authentication pop-ups and the wallet interface to their brand and dapp needs.                                                  |
| <h4><strong>Streamlined Single Sign-On (SSO)</strong></h4>                        | We offer a Single Sign-On (SSO) feature that maps email addresses as unique identifiers. This feature simplifies the login process and ensures the same address is generated and used, enhancing the reusability of user addresses. |
| <h4><strong>Interoperability without Vendor Lock-in</strong></h4>                 | We are backward compatible with the Lit Protocol, allowing existing Lit users to use the same account across different platforms and apps without needing a new address.                                                            |
| <h4><strong>Session Keys</strong></h4>                                            | We use the Lit Protocol’s MPC network as the default session key post-authentication. These temporary session keys confirm transactions without continuous user signatures, improving user experience.                              |
| <h4><strong>Unified Access with WalletConnect and other Aggregators</strong></h4> | We are natively integrated with WalletConnect, enabling access to Aarc user addresses on dApps without direct OpenAuth API/Widget incorporation. This unifies all authentication processes onto a single screen.                    |
| <h4><strong>In-built Key Rotation for Extra security</strong></h4>                | The OpenAuth kit enhances security by implementing key rotation for PKPs, ensuring the integrity and security of user data and transactions.                                                                                        |
