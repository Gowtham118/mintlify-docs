# Verified Links

Here's how:

1. **Creating an Account and API Key**
   * Sign up on the [dashboard ](https://dashboard.aarc.xyz/signup)to create an account. Each account supports up to three API keys.
2. **Creating a Verified Link**
   * To create a verified link, you can:
     * Use the dashboard for a user-friendly interface. _Coming soon!_
     * Send a `POST` request to the `v3/store-verified-link` endpoint with the required token data and your API key. This endpoint generates a verified link that can be used for seamless integration.
