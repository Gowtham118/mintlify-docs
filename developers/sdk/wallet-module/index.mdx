3. Initialise Aarc SDK

```typescript
let aarcSDK = new Wallets(
    80001, // Chain id of the network
    "YOUR_RPC_URL" // RPC URL of the network
);
```

## Smart Wallet Providers

Currently, Aarc SDK supports the following Smart Wallet Provider:

* Safe
* Biconomy
* Alchemy
* ZeroDev
* Etherspot

```typescript
enum WALLET_TYPE {
  BICONOMY,
  SAFE,
  ALCHEMY_SIMPLE_ACCOUNT,
  ZERODEV_KERNEL,
  ETHERSPOT
}
```

With these Wallet Providers integrations, devs can deploy and query about the Smart Wallet directly using the `aarcSDK`
