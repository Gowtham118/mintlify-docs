Learn how Aarc processes each deposit, from the moment a user initiates it to the final on-chain result or refund.

## 1. Initiating a Deposit

A user or dApp begins by creating a **transaction request** on Aarc. This request includes:
* **Desired Destination**: The DeFi app or contract where funds should end up (e.g., vault, lending pool)
* **Target Token/Amount**: The exact token and amount expected on the destination chain

Based on this information, Aarc generates a **unique, single-use deposit address** for the transaction. Users simply send their funds to this address, no token approvals or bridging steps needed.

## 2. Sending Funds

Once the user transfers funds to the deposit address:
1. Aarc's system detects the incoming transaction on the **source chain**
2. The deposit address routes the funds to router contracts for execution via relayer
3. No separate approvals or manual bridging are required, **it's all handled automatically**

If the initial bridging route encounters issues (like low liquidity), we automatically try alternative routes to ensure success.

## 3. Execution & Monitoring

Aarc aggregates routes across multiple swap, bridge, and solvers to:
* **Bridge & Swap** the deposited assets to obtain the **exact** target token
* **Deliver** the final token to the specified destination smart contract or wallet
* **Manage** gas on the destination chain, eliminating the need for users to hold native gas tokens

This process typically completes in **under 1 minute**. During network congestion or liquidity constraints, the system will automatically retry for up to **30 minutes**.

## 4. Completion or Refund

* **Successful Completion** - When executed successfully, funds arrive on the destination chain/contract in the exact amount specified, and any calldata is executed. There are no partial executions or shortfalls.
* **Automatic Refund** - If Aarc cannot fulfill the transaction **within 30 minutes of retries**, we automatically issue a refund:
   * **Where**: Refund type depends on the failure point. Early failures return the original asset on the source chain. Mid-process failures may refund in stablecoin or ETH on the chain where the failure occurred.
   * **No Manual Intervention**: Refunds process automatically without user claims
   * **Fees**: Already-incurred bridging or swap costs may not be reversible
