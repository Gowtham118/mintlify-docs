## Fund Kit **Use Cases**

#### **Cross-Chain Swaps**

Experience seamless cross-chain swaps with the Aarc Fund Kit. It lets users swap tokens across different chains, even the non-EVM ones, without hassle. For example, swapping GMX tokens on Arbitrum for WETH tokens on the Polygon Mainnet. Our smart API takes care of finding the best execution path, whether it's on-chain or off-chain. Users can sit back and enjoy a smooth transaction experience without worrying about the routing and execution process.

#### **Cross-Chain Deposits**

Leverage your assets across multiple chains effortlessly with the Aarc Fund Kit. Imagine having USDT on Ethereum and wanting to open a trading position on a DEX on Optimism. With our kit, you can do this without managing multiple wallets or manually transferring assets between chains. The Aarc Fund Kit takes care of all the asset routing quietly, making the experience straightforward for users.

#### **Cross-Chain Orchestration**

The Aarc Fund Kit streamlines cross-chain contract interactions, making it easy for developers to bridge funds and execute operations across different blockchain networks. This feature is a game-changer, especially for DeFi projects and yield aggregators that work with multiple contracts across various ecosystems to maximize returns and enhance functionalities.

#### **Cross-Chain Checkouts**

Simplify your cross-chain asset purchases with the Aarc Fund Kit. It turns the process into a one-click operation. For instance, if you hold ETH on Ethereum and want to purchase an NFT on Zora, which operates on a different chain, our kit makes it effortless. Just initiate the purchase, and the Aarc Fund Kit will automatically route the ETH from Ethereum to Zora to complete the NFT purchase. This integration hides all the technical complexities from the user, ensuring a fast and efficient transaction process.
